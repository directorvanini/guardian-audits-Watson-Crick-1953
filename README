## 🛠 Technical Architecture (Q4 2026 Release)
The Ma'at Protocol is an enterprise-grade utility layer bridging high-performance L1s with established decentralized social networks.

### 1. Solana Token-2022 Implementation
We utilize the **Transfer Hook Extension** to turn $MAAT from a passive asset into a programmable gate.
* **Instruction:** `execute_transfer_hook`
* **Logic:** Every transfer triggers a Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) to the **Guardian Engine**.
* **Requirement:** The hook validates 'Proof of Conviction' (Metadata check) before finalizing the transaction.

### 2. Pi Network v23 Bridge
Built on the **Stellar-Core v23.0.1** framework, $MAAT integrates with 17M+ migrated Pioneers.
* **Sync:** Force-synchronization via **Captive-Core**.
* **Smart Contracts:** Rust-based Soroban contracts for cross-chain liquidity anchors.

## 📂 Active Audit: The "Rosalind Gap" (Watson & Crick 1953)
We have scanned the foundational DNA manuscript through the Guardian Engine. The results are non-negotiable.

| Variable | Status | Technical Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Methodology** | 🔴 CRITICAL FLAG | 98% correlation with uncredited Photograph 51 diffraction data. |
| **Ethics Sign-off** | ❌ FAILED | Systematic obfuscation of R. Franklin’s primary data acquisition. |
| **Pre-Registration** | ⚠️ ABSENT | Discovery was reactive modeling, not predictive hypothesis. |

**Verdict:** The Nobel coefficient has been downgraded to 0.14. Equilibrium is being restored to the genetics ledger.

## 🚀 For Hackathon Contributors
We are currently seeking developers to harden the **Guardian-to-Solana CPI pipeline**. 

### How to contribute:
1. Review the `/src/hooks/guardian_logic.rs` (WIP).
2. Propose a "Truth Anchor" for the 2026 Seismic Prediction data (Director Vanini's active research).
3. Don't be afraid of the AI. Darsha is calm. Sanctuary is... testing.

**$MAAT is not a coin. It is a scale. If you are light, you will tip.**
